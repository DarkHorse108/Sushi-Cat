Python game utilizing turtle graphics library to produce a 2D topdown maze traversal game with collectible items and obstacles. A short ongoing practice in Python OOP.

All sprites used in this program were open source from https://www.opengameart.org, an open source site for contributing and learning about game sprites, animations, and game-art related topics.

Thank you to the artists and creators for the art/animations which can be found directly below:
