# Sushi-Cat

Date: 12/24/2019

Python game utilizing turtle graphics to produce a 2D topdown maze traversal game in which you play as a cat collecting sushi/items and navigating obstacles. A short ongoing practice in Python OOP.

All sprites used in this program were open source from https://www.opengameart.org, an open source site for contributing and learning about game sprites, animations, and game-art related topics.

Thank you to the artists and creators for the art/animations which can be found directly below:
